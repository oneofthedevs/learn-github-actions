      # Why fetch?
      # Github Actions runs on a different enviroment which is not necessarily connected with the repo, think of it like a docker container
      # So in order to deploy the code, first fetch (clond) the repo in this github action enviroment and then create a build (Artifect)
      # which will later on be sent to Vercel (in this case, can be AWS or DigitalOcean, etc...)
